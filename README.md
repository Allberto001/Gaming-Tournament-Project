## Problem

Competitive gaming has become and incresingly popular espectator "sport". Tournmanets for all kind of games are happening all the time, and have become more accessible to watch thanks to services like Twitch and Youtube.

However, there is still a gap for espectators to get timely updates on tournaments and how their favorite players are peforming. Nowdays, updates are delayed and scattered, based on what event organizers are able to feed to commentators. This problem is especially noticeable in community-driven events where there is no big corporate backing providing the necessary infrastructure.

## Project Description

This project provides two clients: one for tournament organizers to maintain and update the state of the tournament in a timely fashion, and a client for spectators to obtain real-time on the tournament progress and how favorite players are doing.

The spectator client provides additional real-time information to current broadcasts, enhancing their experience.
